## Why

Because every developer should have one Tetris in their portfolio, and because the web platform — vanilla JS, Canvas, Web Audio, service workers, the `<dialog>` element — is more than enough to ship a real game without a framework.

This one also happens to **cryptographically sign your high scores** so you can prove you actually got them.

## Features

- 🎮 **Full Tetris guideline-ish gameplay** — 7-bag random, SRS-style kicks, hold, ghost piece, lock delay, soft/hard drop, level curve, T-spin-friendly scoring.
- 🎨 **Three themes**, two modes, all switchable on the fly:
  - **Classic** — pure B&W, Game Boy DMG / terminal vibe.
  - **Color** — Game Boy Color pixel art with crunchy highlights and shadows.
  - **Modern** — glass tetrominoes with sheen, animations, neon accents.
- 📱 **Plays everywhere** — keyboard, touch (swipe to move, tap to rotate, swipe-down to hard drop), and an on-screen **virtual D-pad** that appears automatically on touch devices.
- 🔍 **Zoom in/out / fit to screen** — board scales independently for tired eyes and tiny phones.
- 🌑 **Plays offline** — PWA + service worker cache. Install it on your phone.
- 🪪 **PGP-signed scoreboard receipts** — finish a game, drop your name/tagline/email, and either download a signed `.txt` you can verify with `gpg --verify`, or submit it to the public scoreboard.
- 🛠️ **Two self-hostable backends** — pick one:
  - **PHP** ([`server-php/`](server-php/)) — drop into any shared PHP host (Siteground, DreamHost, Hostinger, etc.). Used in production at [tetris.rocks](https://tetris.rocks/).
  - **Node + Fastify + SQLite** ([`server-node/`](server-node/)) — deploys to Fly.io with one command.

  Both hold the PGP private key off-disk (above webroot / as a Fly secret) and expose the same `/api/*` HTTP surface. Public key in the repo at [`docs/PUBKEY.asc`](docs/PUBKEY.asc).
- 0️⃣ **Zero frontend dependencies** — no React, no build step, no bundler. Just open `public/index.html`.

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/paulfxyz/tetris.git
cd tetris/public
python3 -m http.server 8000      # or any static server
open http://localhost:8000
```

To run the scoreboard server + PGP signing, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

DAS (delayed auto-shift) is built in for both keyboard and the virtual pad.

## Scoring

| Lines | Base score | × Level |
| ----- | ---------- | ------- |
| 1     | 100        | × level |
| 2     | 300        | × level |
| 3     | 500        | × level |
| 4 (Tetris) | 800   | × level |
| Combo (+ each consecutive clear) | 50 × combo × level |
| Back-to-back Tetris | × 1.5 multiplier |
| Soft drop | +1 per cell |
| Hard drop | +2 per cell |

Level advances every 10 lines. Gravity is `1000 × 0.85^(level-1)` ms per cell (clamped to 50 ms minimum).
